	<h2>1.) BRUSCHETTA</h2>
	Bruschetta is an antipasto (starter dish) from Italy consisting of grilled bread rubbed with garlic and topped with olive oil and salt. Variations may include toppings of tomato, vegetables, beans, cured meat, or cheese. A popular dish is bruschetta with tomatoes; one recipe popular outside Italy involves basil, fresh tomato, garlic and onion or mozzarella. Bruschetta is usually served as a snack or appetizer. In some countries, the prepared topping is marketed as bruschetta.In Italy, bruschetta is often prepared using a brustolina grill. In the Abruzzo region of Italy a variation of bruschetta made with a salame called ventricina is served. Raw pork products and spices encased in pig bladder are aged and the paste spread on open slices of bread which are sometimes grilled.The dish was developed as a way of salvaging bread that was going stale.In Tuscany it is called fettunta and it is usually served without toppings, especially in November, to taste the first oil of the season.

		<h2>2.) PASTA CARBONARA</h2>
		Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with egg (usually yolk), hard cheese (pecorino romano), guanciale (or pancetta), and black pepper. The dish arrived at its modern form, with its current name, in the middle of the 20th century.The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano, or a combination of the two. Spaghetti is the most common pasta, but fettuccine, rigatoni, linguine, or bucatini are also used. Either guanciale or pancetta can be used for the meat component, but lardons of smoked bacon are a common substitute outside Italy.
