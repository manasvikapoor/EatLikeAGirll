	<h2>1.) GYROS</h2>
	A gyro or gyros is a Greek dish made from meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie. Like shawarma and tacos al pastor, it is derived from the lamb-based doner kebab. In Greece it is now most often pork or chicken, whilst beef, chicken, and lamb is common in other countries. It is typically served wrapped or stuffed in a pita, along with ingredients such as tomato, onion, and tzatziki sauce. When the meat is roasted vertically and turning on the spit it is known as Gyro. Wait, it is not done yet. Slices of gyro are then placed in pita with various taste enhancers including sauce, onions, lettuce, tomatoes and potato chips.

		<h2>2.) BOUGATSA</h2>
		Bougatsa is a kind of sweet pie (less sweet if you consider Greek standard) made of phyllo pastry & semolina custard. This is a kind of food that tastes good in daytime, delicious at late night and best enjoyed with pleasant memories. If you want to eat this pie from roadside food court you will also get a sprinkle of powder sugar and cinnamon on top. It may have been invented in the homeland of wheat, what is now modern Turkey, in the Anatolian Provinces of the Ottoman Empire. It became a popular element of Ottoman cuisine or it may date back earlier to the Classical era of the eastern Mediterranean region.
