<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
</div>
<div class ="recipe1">
<ol>
<li>Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat.</li>
<li>Add onion and saute until starting to soften, about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Add garlic and ginger; cook about 30 seconds more.</li>
<li>Add rice vinegar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, mirin, fish sauce, and sriracha sauce; stir to combine.</li>
<li>Add chicken broth and water and bring to a boil.</li>
<li>Reduce heat and simmer about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Add chicken and bok choy; simmer gently until bok choy is just tender, about 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.</li>
<li>Add ramen noodles and return to a boil.</li>
<li>Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
<li>Drain and drizzle with vegetable oil to prevent sticking.</li>
<li>While ramen is cooking, fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs and bring to a boil.</li>
<li>Gently lower eggs into the boiling water and cook until yolks are barely set, about 7 minutes.</li>
<li>Fill a large bowl with ice water.</li>
<li>Transfer soft boiled eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process; let sit about 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Drain eggs, carefully peel away shells, and slice in half.</li>
<li>Divide ramen between 4 bowls. Add broth.</li>
<li>Top each with jalapeno, green onions, cilantro, and soft boiled egg. Serve immediately.</li>
