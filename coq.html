<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
</div>
<div class ="recipe1">
<ol>
<li>Put dried mushrooms in a bowl and pour in hot water.</li>
<li>Set aside until mushrooms are rehydrated.</li>
<li>Place bacon in a large skillet.</li>
<li>Cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned.</li>
<li>Drain bacon slices on paper towels, reserving bacon grease in the skillet.</li>
<li>Coat chicken thighs with flour and season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Working in batches, cook chicken in the bacon grease over medium heat until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
<li>Remove chicken thighs as they brown and place on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
<li>Drain dried mushrooms through cheesecloth, reserving liquid.</li>
<li>Add drained mushrooms, carrots, fresh mushrooms, shallots, and garlic to skillet over medium-high heat; saute for 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Pour 1 cup wine into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon until liquid is reduced, about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Return chicken to the skillet and mix in remaining wine, chicken broth, herbes de Provence, thyme, and bay leaves.</li>
<li>Liquid should partially cover chicken; if more liquid is needed, add reserved water from mushrooms.</li>
<li>Cover skillet and simmer over low heat until chicken is no longer pink in the center, at least 1 hour.</li>
<li>An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
<li>Remove cover from skillet and simmer until sauce is thickened, about 15 minutes more.</li>
<li>Add more quick-mixing flour to sauce to thicken, if desired.</li>
<li>Crumble bacon over chicken and vegetables and garnish with parsley.</li>
